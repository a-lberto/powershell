.SYNOPSIS
    Installs the necessary PowerShell module and repairs the WinGet Package Manager.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script ensures the system is prepared by checking for Admin rights and internet connectivity.
    It then installs or updates the 'Microsoft.WinGet.Client' module from the PSGallery.
    Finally, it attempts to repair the WinGet installation, with a retry mechanism for robustness.
	Tested on Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC.
	Base commands from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/
